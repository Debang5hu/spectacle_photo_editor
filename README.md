# spectacle_photo_editor
A simple project on face detection using python, I just tried to create a spectacle photo editor, it just detect the eye of the person and put the frame over it. Hope you find it interesting!  

To run it on your device you need to have python installed  
then run the command:  

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


To add more frames download it then remove its background and then add the path of it to the 'Frame' variable.  

Limitation:  
lag in sharp face detection  

Have to work on more precise face detection
